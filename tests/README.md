**How to test**

To run tests with pytest, type:
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

To check coverage run:
```bash
python3 -m pytest --cov=.
```

**Tools installation**

Two python packages are needed: `pytest` (to run the tests) and `pytest-cov` (to check coverage). You can get those with pip:

```bash
pip3 install pytest pytest-cov
```
